====== Biomes ======

{{./pasted_image012.png?width=1000}}
This is an example map of a world created with the v7 mapgen. Biomes are clearly visible as differently textured areas. Light grey is the ocean.

{{./pasted_image013.png}}
This diagram summarizes biome placement. The horizontal axis corresponds to the "heat" parameter of the map generator, while the vertical axis is height (not to scale).
Each biome can only directly border biomes that are adjacent in the diagram. E.g., it's not possible to go from [[#azure|Azure]] to [[#redland|Redland]] without crossing [[#purple-swamp|Purple swamp]], even if just oceanic portions of it.

====== Reptile house ======

{{./pasted_image007.png?width=400}} {{./pasted_image006.png?width=400}}
Covered in 2 layers of  {{./pasted_image001.png}} [[Nickel (II) nitrate (Ni(NO3)2)]], the stone underneath is  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_chromium_fluoride.png}} [[Chromium (III) fluoride (CrF3)]]. This applies both to land and ocean.
The landscape is sparsely covered with various types of  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_qui_lucem_1.png}} [[Qui lucem]] (5% density), as well as  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_vastatorem.png}} [[Vastatorem]] (0.5% density, luminous).
The larger and colored [[Timor]] cluster in sparse forests, leaving around large patches of land.
This biome lacks many [[Ores|ores]] in any significant amount, but is the only source of  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_calcium_ore.png}} [[Calcium ore]] and  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_sulfur.png}} [[Sulfur (S)]].
The sky is colored  {{./pasted_image008.png}} [[#C8FF64|''#C8FF64'']] (Pear).

====== Acidic landscapes ======

{{./pasted_image009.png?width=400}} {{./pasted_image010.png?width=400}}
Covered in 5 layers of  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_sodium_peroxide.png}} [[Sodium peroxide (Na2O2)]], the stone underneath is  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_chromia.png}} [[Chromium (III) oxide (Cr2O3)]]. This applies both to land and ocean.
The flora is densely distributed, and comprises various types of  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_odorantur_1.png}} [[Odorantur]] (10% density), as well as  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_imitationis.png}} [[Imitationis]] (10% density),  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_nihil.png}} [[Nihil]] (10% density),  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_conc.png}} [[Conc]] (1% density) and the taller  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_lectica.png}} [[Lectica]] and  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_veteris.png}} [[Veteris]].
Forests are composed of the smaller [[Altitudo]] and the extremely tall [[Colossus]].
This biome lacks many ores in a significant amount.
The sky is colored  {{./pasted_image011.png}} [[#FFFF64|''#FFFF64'']] (Canary).

====== Redland ======

{{./pasted_image017.png?width=400}} {{./pasted_image016.png?width=400}}
The land is covered in a layer of  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_red_mercury_oxide.png}} [[Mercury (II) oxide (HgO, red)]] and a further, underlying filler layer of  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_mercury_oxide.png}} [[Mercury (II) oxide (HgO)]]; the stone underneath is  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_cinnabar.png}} [[Cinnabar (HgS)]].
Redland is a barren biome, with very little flora. Only  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_caput.png}} [[Caput]] (1% density),  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_pusilli.png}} [[Pusilli]] (1% density) and  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_quercu.png}} [[Quercu]] thrive here, although they are able to grow on all three layers.
Azure contains every ore except  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_calcium_ore.png}} [[Calcium ore]],  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_sulfur.png}} [[Sulfur (S)]] and  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_cuprous_oxide_ore.png}} [[Cuprous oxide ore]].
The sky is colored  {{./pasted_image018.png}} ''#FFC896'' (Light peach).
The oceanic portion of this biome, and near-sea level land up to y = 4, is governed by a different sub-biome, **Mercury ocean**.

{{./pasted_image015.png?width=400}}
This sub-biome is covered in 3 layers of  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_lead_sulfate.png}} [[Lead (II) sulfate (PbSO4)]] rather than the mercury oxides typical of Redland.
Additionally, only  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_viriditas.png}} [[Viriditas]] (1% density) can appear here.

====== Purple swamp ======

{{./pasted_image014.png?width=400}} {{./pasted_image025.png?width=400}}
There are no soil layers in this biome, only monolithic stone ground made of  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_ammonium_manganese_pyrophosphate.png}} [[Ammonium manganese (III) pyrophosphate]].
Flora in the Purple swamp comprise the two varieties of  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_petite_1.png}} [[Petite]] (5% density), as well as  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_grebe.png}} [[Grebe]] (1% density),  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_periculum.png}} [[Periculum]] (1% density, luminous),  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_secreta.png}} [[Secreta]] (1% density) and multiple taller grasses:  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_avarum.png}} [[Avarum]],  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_cruento.png}} [[Cruento]],  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_rami.png}} [[Rami]] and  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_spears.png}} [[Spears]].
Additionally, the unusual, luminous and sometimes quite long  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_naga.png}} [[Naga]] hangs down from cliffs and caves, along with twisted, stalactite-like  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_ammonium_manganese_pyrophosphate.png}} [[Ammonium manganese (III) pyrophosphate]] columns.
The dense forests are entirely comprised of the mushroom-like [[Turris]].
While the  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_ammonium_manganese_pyrophosphate.png}} [[Ammonium manganese (III) pyrophosphate]] contains no ores, abundant patches of [[#redland|Redland]] and [[Azure]], as well as raw  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_cinnabar.png}} [[Cinnabar (HgS)]], are usually mixed into the terrain.
The sky is colored  {{./pasted_image020.png}} [[#BE9BFF|''#BE9BFF'']] (Pastel purple).
In very deep oceans and caves, with surface level below y = -15, the **Swamp connector** sub-biome appears.

{{./pasted_image028.png?width=400}} {{./pasted_image023.png?width=400}}
Unlike the regular Purple swamp, here it is possible to find liquid  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_potassium_permanganate.png}} [[Potassium permanganate (KMnO4)]] that lies below the regular ocean or replacing springs in caves.
Only  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_naga.png}} [[Naga]] may spawn here, dimly illuminating caves.

====== Azure ======

{{./pasted_image021.png?width=400}} {{./pasted_image022.png?width=400}}
Azure is covered in 2 layers of  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_copper_sulfate.png}} [[Copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4 * 5H2O)]], with the underslying stone being  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_cobalt_blue.png}} [[Cobalt blue (CoAl2O4)]].
Flora is abundant and varied, beginning with the multiple varieties of  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_pars_1.png}} [[Pars]] (10% density), and going on with  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_picea.png}} [[Picea]] (5% density),  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_purpura.png}} [[Purpura]] (5% density, luminous) and  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_rosea.png}} [[Rosea]] (5% density), to finish with the 3 variants of the tall  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_truncus_1.png}} [[Truncus]].
Regarding forests, they contain the smaller, mushroom-like [[Rete]] and the tall, dimly luminous, densely overlapping [[Viridi petasum]].
Azure contains every ore except  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_calcium_ore.png}} [[Calcium ore]] and  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_sulfur.png}} [[Sulfur (S)]]. It also contains large blobs of  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_humus.png}} [[Humus]] at or near the surface.
Oceans and caves below level y = -10 use the somewhat different sub-biome **Azure bottom**.

{{./pasted_image027.png?width=400}} {{./pasted_image026.png?width=400}}
This sub-biome lacks the top layer of {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_copper_sulfate.png}} [[Copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4 * 5H2O)]], so the darker {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_cobalt_blue.png}} [[Cobalt blue (CoAl2O4)]] is exposed.
Here it is only possible to find  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_deus.png}} [[Deus]] (10% density),  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_infernum.png}} [[Infernum]] (10% density) and  {{~/.minetest/games/loria/mods/loria/textures/loria_vult.png}} [[Vult]] (10% density), all of them brightly luminous.
